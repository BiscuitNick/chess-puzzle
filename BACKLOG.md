## High Priority

### Auto-advance puzzles in timed modes
- **Issue**: Auto-advancing to the next puzzle after correct moves is causing issues
- **Affected modes**: Sprint (primarily), potentially Streak
- **Current workaround**: Disabled auto-advance; all modes now show the result modal requiring user to click "Next Puzzle"
- **Expected behavior**: In Sprint mode, correct moves should automatically load the next puzzle without requiring user interaction to maintain fast-paced gameplay
- **Location**: `scripts/ui/puzzle_screen.gd` - `_on_puzzle_solved()` function
